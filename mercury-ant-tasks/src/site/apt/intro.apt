Mercury Ant Tasks

 This project is an implementation of Ant wrapper for Mercury functionality. It also implements a
subset of <<maven-ant-tasks>> syntax (and, of cause - functionality). Please note that below is a description of
<<all>> available options; routine usage is much simpler:

+------------------------------------------+
<javac srcdir="src/main/java"
       destdir="target/classes"
>
  <classpath>
    <deps>
      <dependency name="asm:asm:3.0"/>
    </deps>
  </classpath>
</javac>
+------------------------------------------+

   * <<configuration>>

     * named authentication elements to be used by repository or proxy authentication

     * supports both name/password or certificate pointer (file or URL) plus optional password

     * named repository configurations

     * local repositories (not limited to one)

     * remote repositories

     * stream verification per repository - separate for reading and writing

     * currently supported SHA-1 and PGP (.asc)

     * default configuration is provided if no configuration is specified in the

     * repositories defined outside <<<config>>> element are automatically added

   * <<named dependency sets>>

     * lists dependencies and optionally - their Maven scopes

     * standardized on a one-string naming convention

     * supports OSGi-syntax version ranges

   * <<ant path creation/alteration>>

     * a task that either creates a new ant path or adds to existing one

     * optionally allows to specify Maven-like scope for the path resolution

   * <<repository writes>>

     * allows to write named files into repositories

     * optional classifiers, types

     * signature generation is configured per repository

     * SHA1, PGP
